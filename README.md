Weather data

-	Use thresholding for weather data (see chapter 10) note that we can choose thresholds in a supervised or unsupervised way.
-	We could start by seeing: how does each weather feature correlate to the numbikes.
-	Unsupervised thresholding: basically split at the mean.
-	Supervised thresholding:p309, use number of bikes as a ranker. 
-	I also want to try to organize weekhours into days: if the weather is bad in the morning, does that impact the bikes for the rest of that day?? Turn ordinal data into categorical: organize weekhour by day.
